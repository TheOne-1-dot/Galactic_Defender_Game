Description
-Defend the Galaxy Game is a simple browser-based game where the player controls a spaceship to shoot down enemy ships while avoiding collisions. -The goal is to survive as long as possible and earn points by destroying enemy ships.

MVP
-Spaceship movement: The player can move the spaceship left and right to avoid collisions(Eventually move up down as well).
-Shooting mechanism: The player can shoot projectiles from the spaceship to destroy enemy ships.
-Enemy generation: Enemy ships appear on the screen at regular intervals and move downward.
-Collision detection: Detect collisions between projectiles and enemy ships, as well as between the player's spaceship and enemy ships.
-Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of enemy ships destroyed.


Backlog
-Power-ups: Introduce power-up items that enhance the player's abilities or provide temporary advantages.
-Sound effects and music: Add sound effects for shooting, collisions, and background music to enhance the gaming experience (eventually).
-Advanced enemy behavior: Implement different types of enemy ships with unique movement patterns and attack strategies.
-Levels and progression: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty and progression mechanics.

Data structure
-Spaceship class: Contains properties and methods for controlling the player's spaceship.
-Enemy class: Defines properties and behavior for enemy ships.
-Game class: Manages the game state, including player score, enemy generation, collision detection, and game loop.


States & States Transitions
-Main game state: Controls the main gameplay loop, including player movement, shooting, enemy generation, and collision detection.
-Game over state: Activated when the player's spaceship is destroyed, displaying the game over screen and final score.


Tasks
-Implement spaceship movement and shooting mechanics.
-Create enemy ship generation and movement logic.
-Implement collision detection between projectiles and enemy ships.
-Track the player's score and update the display accordingly.
-Add game over logic and screen display.
-Test the game for bugs and optimize performance.
-Enhance user interface and add visual effects.
-Implement additional features from the backlog.
